# Task Management System

## Overview
The **Task Management System** is a web-based application designed to help teams and individuals efficiently create, assign, track, and manage tasks. Built using Django as the backend framework and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, the system provides a robust and scalable solution for task organization and collaboration.

## Features
### 1. User Authentication & Role Management
- **Admin/Superuser:**
  - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for tasks.
  - User and role management capabilities.
  - Access to all system features.
- **Regular Users:**
  - Can create, assign, and track tasks.
  - Limited CRUD functionalities based on assigned permissions.

### 2. Task Management (CRUD Operations)
- **Create Tasks:** Define task title, description, priority, deadline, and assign users.
- **Read Tasks:** View all tasks with detailed statuses.
- **Update Tasks:** Modify task attributes, including deadlines and assignees.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove completed or unnecessary tasks.

### 3. Database Management
- **Django ORM** is used to manage the database seamlessly.
- Models include:
  - `User Model`: Stores user roles and authentication details.
  - `Task Model`: Contains task-specific attributes.
  - `Role Model`: Defines permissions within the system.

### 4. UI & UX
- **Dashboard:** Displays task summaries and system notifications.
- **Task List:** Categorizes tasks into pending, ongoing, and completed.
- **Task Details Page:** Provides in-depth information about each task.
- **User Management Panel:** Enables admin control over user roles.

### 5. Security & Reliability
- Built-in **authentication & authorization** using Djangoâ€™s secure framework.
- Protection against **SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and CSRF attacks**.
- **Secure password hashing** with PBKDF2 and Argon2.
- **Session management and secure cookies** to prevent unauthorized access.

## Technology Stack
### Backend:
- **Django (Python-based)**: Provides a scalable, robust backend framework.
- **Django ORM**: Manages database operations seamlessly.

### Frontend:
- **HTML & Tailwind CSS**: Ensures a modern and responsive UI.
- **Tailwind CSS Utility-First Approach**:
  - Faster UI development.
  - Predefined classes for styling.
  - Mobile-first responsive design.
